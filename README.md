# Brain-Tumour-Detection

In this project I developed and implemented deep learning models (CNN, ResNet50, VGG16) for brain tumor classification and segmentation using MRI images.

I was able to achieve the following accuracy : 
1. CNN :  0.9929971694946289
2. ResNet : 0.9724637866020203
3. VGG 16 : 0.908695638179779
